    "content": "I am a frontend developer with a passion for continuous development and improving my skills to create quality and user-friendly products.\n\nMy journey into development started with writing a small text-based Android game, which made me realize that programming is what I want to do.\n\nWith over three years of experience with frontend frameworks (mostly React, but also experience with Vue and Angular), I've gained the skills to create quality and responsive user interfaces. I have worked on a variety of projects including corporate websites, admin panels and mobile apps.\n\nIn addition, I have experience mentoring colleagues in the internship phase and I am always willing to share my knowledge and experience. I believe that teaching others is a great way to improve my skills and broaden my understanding of a subject area.\n\nAt the moment my preferred technology is React / Vue.",
